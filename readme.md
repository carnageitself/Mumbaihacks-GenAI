Excited to share my latest project – a cool quiz feature! 🚀 As a student, I wanted to make studying more fun, so I built a system where admins (like me!) can create quizzes super easily. What's even cooler? The quiz automatically stops 24 hours after it's scheduled. 🕒

I used the awesome combo of React.js for the front end, Node.js, and Express for the back end, and MongoDB for storing all the quiz magic. 📚✨ But here's the techy part – I hooked it all up with RESTful APIs and JWT authentication for security ninja vibes. 🔒
